🌀 1-Jointed Rotary Mechanism (Fusion 360)

📌 Project Overview



This repository contains a 1-jointed rotary mechanism designed in Autodesk Fusion 360 and exported as both STEP and STL files.

The mechanism demonstrates a simple single-axis rotational joint, useful for basic mechanical motion studies, robotics prototypes, or CAD assembly practice.



⚙️ Mechanism Description



The design includes one rotating component connected to a fixed base through a revolute joint, allowing smooth rotation around a single pivot axis.



Key Characteristics:



Joint Type: Revolute (Rotary)



Degrees of Freedom: 1



Motion: Rotation about one axis



Designed In: Fusion 360

🛠️ How to Open the Files

✅ STEP File (Recommended for CAD Editing)



Open Fusion 360



Go to File → Open



Upload and open rotary\_mechanism.step



The model will appear as an editable solid body



✅ STL File (Recommended for 3D Printing)



Open your slicer software (Cura, PrusaSlicer, etc.)



Import rotary\_mechanism.stl



Slice and print as needed



▶️ Motion \& Joint Simulation (Fusion 360)



To simulate the rotary movement:



Import the STEP file into Fusion 360



Switch to the Assemble workspace



Create a Revolute Joint between the base and rotating arm



Use Drive Joint to animate rotation
