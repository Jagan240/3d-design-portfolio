🌀 Twisted Clamp Design

📌 Project Overview



The Twisted Clamp Design is a mechanical clamp component featuring a unique twisted geometry, developed for gripping, mounting, and structural holding applications. Designed in Autodesk Fusion 360, this part combines functional clamping strength with a smooth, aesthetic transition that makes it suitable for both industrial and prototype use.



The design is optimized for manufacturing through 3D printing or Cilling machining, making it adaptable for rapid prototyping as well as real-world mechanical assemblies.



🛠️ Software Used



Autodesk Fusion 360

Used for CAD modeling, parametric design, and exporting manufacturing-ready formats.



⚙️ Key Features

✅ Smooth Twisted Geometry



The clamp incorporates a gradual twisted transition, providing:



Enhanced structural form



Improved ergonomic handling



A distinctive mechanical aesthetic



This twist also helps distribute stress more evenly compared to sharp angular transitions.



✅ Secure Mounting Support



The component includes mounting hole provisions, allowing it to be easily attached to:



Frames and brackets



Workbenches



Mechanical rigs



Custom assemblies



This makes it practical for both stationary and modular applications.



✅ Manufacturing Optimized



The clamp is designed with production flexibility in mind:



STL file for 3D printing workflows



STEP file for CNC machining and CAD interoperability



Geometry optimized for minimal support material and strong print orientation



✅ Versatile Applications



This clamp design can be used in:



Mechanical gripping systems



Tool and fixture mounting



Robotics structural support



Workshop clamping setups



Prototype testing environments
